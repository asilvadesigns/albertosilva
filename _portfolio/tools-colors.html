summary: |
    I was reading an article on CSS-Tricks and I noticed in one of
    the codepens a web color I haven't seen before, namely, "dodgerblue".
    This led me to reserach to my surprise there are over a hundred CSS
    color names, apart from hex values. So I had to make a personal reference.
